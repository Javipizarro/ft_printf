- Check the 'minimum field width' with values bigger, equal and smaller than the string with -
- Check the 'minimum field width' with values bigger, equal and smaller than the string with 0
- Check the '.' with multiple precisions
Advanced Flags Management
- Use the 's' conversion for all the following test
- Check '*' as minimum field width (try values like negative one, zero etc.)
- Check '*' as precision (try values like negative one, zero etc.)
- Check '*' as both with/without one other flag (try values like negative one, zero etc.)

Bonus
We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part is excellent. This means that you must complete the mandatory part, beginning to end, and your error management must be flawless, even in cases of twisted or bad usage. So if you didn't score all the points on the mandatory part during this defence bonuses will be totally ignored.
